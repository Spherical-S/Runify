# Runify

V1.0.0

Rather than trying to find a playlist that has a good tempo AND songs they actually like, using Runify, runners can find songs that are already in their playlists that would be good to run to.

Runners can specify a range for the tempo so that they can time their steps to the beat in order to keep a steady cadence.
Runners can also specify how "danceable" and "energetic" the songs should be and get a list of songs that have the tempo specified
and songs that match the danceablity and energy levels specified.

# Security

* Windows may detect Runify as a virus, it is a **false positive** and may be ignored.
* If windows says it protected your PC, you may still run runify/the runify installer by clicking on "More info" then "run anyways"
